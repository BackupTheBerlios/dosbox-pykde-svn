Dosbox-pykde_
===============

This is the homepage of dosbox-pykde_.  Not much here yet, just started writing the page.

--------------------
What is it?
--------------------

Dosbox-pykde is a frontend for dosbox_ for the KDE_ desktop.  It is similar to other frontends 
for dosbox.  The major difference with this one, is that it is centered around file management.  
This frontend is designed to separate the freshly installed files from the changed 
file, configuration files, and saved games.  Every game entry in 
the frontend is split between two different archives.  The first 
archive is a zipfile created upon entry to the frontend.  This is 
meant to save a fresh install.  The secondary, or extras archive, is 
a tarball whose contents are generated from an rdiff-backup of the 
leftover or changed files relative to the install archive.


Although it is currently usable, it is still being considered in the planning stage until I work 
out some of the features.  I may make it optional to tarball the secondary archive, and let the 
user be able to just hold an rdiff-backup directory.  I may make rdiff-backup optional, and make 
a cheap internal replacement for it.  I don't really have a frontend to handle configurations yet.  
Currently, only one default configuration is supported, with per game overrides.  Autoexec lines in the configuration are not yet supported.

Goals
-------------------
One of the goals of this project is to provide a good example application of PyKDE_.  I have 
spent some extra time in writing comments throughout the code detailing some of PyKDE.  
As of now, there are very few applications that use PyKDE primarily.  There are quite a few,
not very many, but a few that use PyQt.  The PyKDE environment is much richer than the
PyQt environment, and provides easier widgets to work with.  The sad fact is that there the 
current state of documentation and examples are pretty poor, leaving developers to read 
through the C++ documentation.  This is not always easy for a person who is primarily a 
python user to do.  This program makes an attempt to ease entry into programming with 
PyKDE.  I will make an attempt, where possible or applicable, to use PyKDE the way it 
"should" be used.  I heartily welcome suggestions that help this.  

I do believe in using pure python where it is more appropriate, and using the PyKDE/PyQt 
widgets where they are best represented.  One of the strengths of Qt and even KDE in the 
C++ environment is that they offer access to many things that are already handled by python.  
For example, in Qt, there is a QString type that provides many methods for dealing with 
strings.  In python, the string type already has methods for dealing with string objects, and a 
python programmer would probably be more familiar with those.  So while knowing how to 
use QString objects may really help the C++ programmer, they are more likely to just be in 
the python programmer's way.  Other examples are the QMap and QList types, which are 
handled by the dictionary and list objects in python.  Network functions and XML processing 
are preferred to be handled by python in lieu of using the Qt equivalents.



--------------------

Dependencies
--------------------

- Main Dependencies:

  - Python_ - The whole application is written in python.

  - PyKDE_ - Python bindings for the KDE desktop environment.

  - forgetHTML_ - A pythonic way of writing HTML documents.

  - rdiff-backup_ - Used for making incremental backups of saved games and configurations.

  - dosbox_ - This is a frontend for dosbox.  The application has little value without this.

- Dependencies that may be either removed or optional in the future:

  - rsync_ - Used to copy the files from an rdiff-backup restoration to the dosbox directory.
    
    - This may be replaced later with shutil.copytree().

  - tar_ - Used to archive the rdiff-backup repositories, I'm afraid to use zip for this.

  - bzip2_ - Used with tar above to compress the rdiff-backup repositories.

Intended Audience/Users
----------------------------------

KDE users on i386/amd64 architectures.

----------------------

Download
--------------

Currently the best way to obtain dosbox-pykde is through subversion::

	  svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/dosbox-pykde/trunk dosbox-pykde


svn_ access (This will work in konqueror.)

-----------------------

Install
-----------------------

The python distutils are used to install this application.

In the toplevel directory, type::

       ./setup.py install

or type::

	python setup.py install

and everything should install.

To run from the source tree, type::

   PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/lib ./dosbox-pykde
